## My approach to building AI systems

```python
def architect_ai_system(business_requirements):
    """
    Lessons from shipping AI to production:
    1. Start with the data pipeline (garbage in, garbage out)
    2. Vector databases are the new relational databases
    3. Prompt engineering is systematic, not magic
    4. Always have a fallback to traditional algorithms
    5. Monitor for drift, hallucinations, and edge cases
    """
    if requires_compliance():
        return multi_layer_validation() + audit_trails()
    elif requires_scale():
        return async_processing() + caching_layers()
    return simple_and_maintainable()
```
